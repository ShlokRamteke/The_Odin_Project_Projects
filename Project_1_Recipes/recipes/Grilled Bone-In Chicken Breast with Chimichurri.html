    <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
    <p>Juicy, herb-rubbed chicken breasts are grilled up to perfection and drizzled with flavor-packed chimichurri. It's a great main dish for summertime. Serve with fresh grilled corn on the cob and a crusty bread </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cloves garlic  </li>
        <li>1 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley </li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley  </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning </li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lime juice  </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>4 (6 ounce) bone-in chicken breast halve</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon herb rub with salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place garlic in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add cilantro, parsley, oregano, and salt; pulse until finely chopped. Drizzle in oil, vinegar, and lime juice slowly, while the blade is spinning. Process for about 1 minute. Cover with a lid and store chimichurri in the refrigerator until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. </li>
        <li>Rub chicken breasts on all sides with herb rub.</li>
        <li>Turn the middle burners to low on the preheated grill and place chicken, skin-side down, over those burners. Close the lid and cook for 5 minutes. Turn the middle burners off and flip chicken. Close lid and cook until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Serve chicken with chimichurri.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4> Cook's Note</h4>
    <p>The tablespoon of spice rub is your choice. I use a honey and herb rub from Spicewalla. But don't overthink it--the flavor comes from the chicken bones and the chimichurri.</p>
